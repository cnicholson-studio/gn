 We practice architecture that reflects a genuine desire to understand the complexity of our regional landscape.  We find inspiration in the historical, cultural, and natural layers that make up of our local context.  Our projects are constructed with attention to site, light, material, and proportion for a result that is both practical and poetic.  
Alice Guess is a registered architect and faculty member of the Savannah College of Art and Design School of the Building Arts.  She has won numerous teaching awards and accolades for her commitment to design education.  
Gordon Nicholson is an award-winning registered architect and has taught at several academic institutions.  He is also an artist with work in both private and permanent collections.
